# ML pipeline for a Trained Deep Learning Model

This repo contains the code for a simple Kubeflow ML pipeline for a trained deep learning model for the upcoming Manning book on machine learning with tabular data. This is part of the code for the end-to-end deep learning and MLOps chapter.

- [train_script.py](https://github.com/ryanmark1867/ml_pipeline_basics/blob/master/train_script.py): model training script - adapted from 
- [pipeline_script.py](https://github.com/ryanmark1867/ml_pipeline_basics/blob/master/pipeline_script.py): script for Kubeflow pipeline

Here are the articles that describe the deployments in more detail:
